# Particle-Image-Velocimetry

An optical method of flow visualization, used to obtain instantaneous velocity measurements and related properties in fluids.

Here there are a lot of testings to find a way to get the velocities I wanted, I checked different types of correlations, I used some algorithms from PIV methods.
