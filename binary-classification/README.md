# binary-classification

If we have clean hive we can detect if there is pollen. When the hive is full of nectar and pollen we can't have good results, because the accuracy will be always 100%

The main idea was to see if there is any pollen on the bodies of the bees. So with this binary classification we can detect the pollen on the hive with CNN model.

The result was that there is pollen in all the bees so that's why the accuracy was 100%.
