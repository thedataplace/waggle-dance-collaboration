# bee-tracker

Bee tracker from the raw video without any preprocess

It's not working in long videos, probably will be fine in smaller clips, and the annotations will be easier.

The idea was to create this tracker to find manual the waggle dances from the video, but it's not working because the video is quite big and when I'm running the code the video stuck on the first frame and it's not moving
